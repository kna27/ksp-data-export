# KSP Data Export

## Introduction

Ever wanted to view your KSP flight data in a graph? Well, this mod allows you to do that! Simply choose which values you would like to log, and all of your flight data will get exported to a CSV file!

You can then open this CSV file in a program such as Excel and make as many charts and graphs as you desire!

## Reporting Bugs

The current version of the mod is **DEV ONLY**, do not download unless you know what you are doing.

As such, do not report any bugs. I know that there are a lot,  and I am getting to them. As soon as an official build is made, feel free to report any bugs you find.

## Installation
This mod has only been tested on Windows.

1. Download the GameData/KSPMissionKontrol folder.
2. Copy the KSPMissionKontrol folder to `YourKSPInstallDirectory/Kerbal Space Program/GameData`
 
Your directory should look like: `YourKSPInstallDirectory/Kerbal Space Program/GameData/DataExport` if done correctly.

## How to use

Press `alt + n` to open the GUI for the mod.

Detailed instructions will be coming soon.
